Tasks
The following are the broad tasks to be performed:
Load the data into your code
Keep 20% of the data aside as test data.
Apply the required preprocessing techniques on the data.
Apply different machine learning techniques.
Tune the parameters of models as required.
Build a model named ‘final_model’
Report the following metrics using ‘final_model’ on the test data:
Accuracy
F1-score
Display the confusion matrix
Report the importance of different features.
Prepare a brief report documenting the key steps involved along with the reasoning
behind different decisions that you made in these steps.

Notes
Write textual comments in your code wherever appropriate.
Note: As a data scientist, you might need to make several decisions while exploring the data.
feel free to do that and mention the same in the report.
Be as innovative and creative as possible. Visualize data wherever required.
